            <hr class="sm">
<p>Awareness of user expectations when dealing with the public sector 
through eGovernment services may facilitate the interaction between 
public administrations and users. Open eGovernment services should be 
developed around how users can, want, or need to use those services, 
rather than forcing people to use a service that does not meet their 
expectations. </p>
<p>Articulating these expectations requires service designers not only 
to analyse and envision the way the service will be used by citizens and
 businesses, but also to validate their assumptions. It is also 
important that once services have been developed, users continue to 
contribute to their improvement. This requires training of developers in
 emerging user-centered design methodologies and tools. Methodologies 
for co-creation can also support this action and eParticipation can be 
used as a means to assess existing services, to learn of citizens and 
businesses’ needs and to co-create new solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, these processes should consider different groups within 
society, e.g., migrants, elderly, people with disabilities and computer 
illiterate.</p>

            <h3 class="nomargin" id="universal">Universal accessibility of services</h3>
            <hr class="sm">
<p>Universal accessibility is a fundamental requirement for the success 
of any open eGovernment. In contrast to the private sector, which can be
 excluding by reaching only target market segments, public 
administrations should design open eGovernment services that are 
inclusive by default and cater to the needs of everyone. However, 
accessibility options are often few and ill-locatable on open 
eGovernment services.</p>
<p>Considerations for universal accessibility of services are related to
 alternatives for audio content, such as transcripts and captions or 
sign language; page structure and content, which need to be properly 
coded so that they can cater to text-to-speech synthesis or audio 
descriptions; and textual content that follows Easy-to-Read guidelines.
Although there are international guidelines such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank" class="external-link">WCAG 2.0</a>
 for the design of accessible websites, it is generally agreed that they
 do not cater to people with cognitive difficulties so greater effort 
should be applied in this respect. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines 
Working Group is working on requirements for a WCAG 3.0 version that 
should widen the spectrum of the 2.0 version.</p>

 which regulates accessibility of public sector websites and mobile 
applications in the EU, will reduce uncertainty for developers and 
foster interoperability. Member States are expected to comply with this 
directive by September 2018.</p> 
<p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2015:0615:FIN">The European Accessibility Act</a>,

<p>In general, only one third of public sector websites in the EU are 
mobile-friendly. Specifically, there is a lack of mobile apps for 
eGovernment services.</p>
<p>As mobiles are fast becoming the main device through which people 
access the internet, it is imperative that more services are provided 
through mobile friendly websites or apps that would open access to a 
greater number of citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>Moreover, public administrations should be up to date on new 
developments of devices and eGovernment services should be responsive.</p>

            <hr class="sm">
<p>The once-only principle states that a user should not have to supply 
the same information more than once to public administrations. Open 
eGovernment services should offer this option to users whenever 
possible. However, people should not be forced to apply it.</p>
<p>Interoperability and identification play a very important role in 
meeting his principle; that is why the European Interoperability 
Framework (EIF), and the eIDAS directive are recommended here. The use 
of open source software, open standards and open APIs will result in 
more open and scalable ICT systems for public service delivery. This 
will pave the way for the integration of systems and the implementation 
of the once-only principle for citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>An interesting approach, which is also relevant for people's access 
to their own data, is to provide a personal-data repository that 
applications can access when necessary, instead of having applications 
exchanging personal data. </p> <span class="label label-info pull-right margin-t1em">Stimulating the creation, delivery and use of new services</span>

<p>Personalisation is a way to improve user satisfaction by tailoring a 
service to specific individuals or segments of individuals' needs. Open 
eGovernment services should be customisable and adapt to the user or 
group of users' profile. Besides, services should be proactive, and 
notify or prompt a person to use them according to circumstances like 
age or health-related parameters.</p>

<p>Language support should include not only the translation of website

<p>Allowing people to "own", use and amend their data could go a long 
way to make them more invested in the services they use and more 
trusting of government. Additionally, it would cut down on information 
queries by governments and allow for faster resolution times. According 
to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf" target="_blank" class="external_link">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>,
 people have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether personal 
data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. Yet
 only 55% of the EU Member States make this access possible for 
citizens.</p>
<p>It is important to understand how people think about their data in 
relation to public services and how they would like to interact with 
them. Also, people should know if their data are linked to data from 
other services. Research to comprehend how citizen- controlled data are 
understood and accepted in government is also vital to drive this trend 
forward.</p>
<p>This recommendation is especially relevant for the once-only 
principle. Control on one’s own data should go beyond all or nothing; 
people should be able to decide what data can be shared and with whom..</p> <span class="label label-danger pull-right margin-t1em">Increased transparency of and trust in public administration</span>

<p>Public administration’s open data that is machine-readable and that 
is capable of being shared and distributed, allows the development of 
solutions that cater to the increasing demand for transparency, 
accountability, and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms transparency is essential for digital trust and 
appropriation of emerging technologies. An important shift deals with 
control of the data used and the intelligibility of algorithms.</p>
<p>Openness of data implies the use of standards for data management, 
digital services and metadata, as well as shared concepts and terms 
(when available). Openness of services implies the use of open source 
software where there is no risk of vendor lock-in and code may be 
reviewed and maintained by the parties involved in the development of 
solutions. </p>
<p>The availability of open data together with open service components, 
will enable the development of new solutions by third parties and the 
public administration itself, and will foster reuse by small local 
governments that lack resources for the development of services.</p>

                    <p>eDemocracy enhances citizen and businesses 
engagement and participation in government decision making processes 
such as policy making, budgeting and service delivery. It is fundamental
 for user adoption and for building trust towards the public sector.  </p>
<p>In general, eDemocracy and eParticipation are not offered as services
 on eGovernment websites in the EU. Public authorities should take into 
account a number of success factors for eParticipation projects, 
including strong government support (with a commitment to act on input 
received); a user-friendly interface; the use of different channels of 
communication (offline as well as online); appropriate security and 
privacy provisions (ranging from anonymous responses to fully identified
 participants); and a political issue that can be addressed in a way 
understandable by non-experts. Tools should include features such as web
 forums, discussion spaces and social media interaction, and make sure 
that the input is transparently processed.</p>

<p>Providing eProcurement, eTender and eInvoicing services is very 
important to level the playing field and ease access to the information 
for all businesses, and thus develop the potential for bidding for 
public contracts procurement opportunities and tenders.</p>
<p>The transition of European Member States towards full eProcurement 
and use of contract registers is necessary. The focus should be on 
setting up eProcurement and eTender websites that are easily accessible 
for businesses of all sizes. Besides, open data on eProcurement 
guarantees transparency in the management of public funds. As with other
 eGovernment services, a user focused approach would be necessary to 
gauge both the interest and the usefulness of such websites and how they
 can be designed to ensure maximum take-up by businesses. </p>
